# Phys763.HW3 – Readout Analysis

This repository contains a **coursework assignment** developed as part of **PHY 763 – Quantum Computing Laboratory** at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.

The work focuses on the **analysis and physical interpretation of experimental qubit readout data** obtained from a superconducting qubit platform.  
All datasets used in this repository were **provided by the course instructors** for educational purposes.

## Context

This notebook corresponds to **Homework 3** of PHY 763 and is **not an independent research project**.  
The goal of the assignment was to develop intuition for experimental limitations in qubit readout rather than to optimize software performance.

## Objectives

The analysis aims to:

- Examine dispersive qubit readout signals from experimental data
- Study signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) behavior
- Evaluate readout fidelity and its dependence on experimental parameters
- Identify physical limitations arising from relaxation processes (e.g., T1 decay)
