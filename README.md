# Phys763.HW3 – Readout Analysis

This repository contains a **coursework assignment** developed as part of **PHY 763** at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.

The work focuses on the **analysis and physical interpretation of experimental qubit readout data** obtained from a superconducting qubit platform.  
All datasets used in this repository were **provided by the course instructors** for educational purposes.

---

## Context

This notebook corresponds to **Homework 3** of PHY 763 and is **not an independent research project**.  
The goal of the assignment was to develop intuition for experimental limitations in qubit readout rather than to optimize software performance.

---

## Objectives

The analysis aims to:

- Examine dispersive qubit readout signals from experimental data
- Study signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) behavior
- Evaluate readout fidelity and its dependence on experimental parameters
- Identify physical limitations arising from relaxation processes (e.g., T1 decay)

## Data Disclaimer

All experimental datasets included in this repository:

- Were **provided by the PHY 763 instructional staff**
- Are used **strictly for educational analysis**
- Do **not** represent original data collected by the author

The analysis and interpretation of the data were performed independently by the author as part of the coursework.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this assignment, I developed experience in:

- Analyzing experimental readout data from superconducting qubits
- Interpreting signal-to-noise scaling and its impact on readout fidelity
- Connecting experimental observations to physical processes such as relaxation (T1)
- Working with real hardware datasets using Python and Jupyter notebooks

## Usage

This notebook is intended to be **read and reviewed**, rather than executed independently.

It depends on experimental datasets and calibration infrastructure available through the **QOLab / Qualibrate environment used in PHY 763**, which are not publicly accessible.

For this reason, the `data` directory is intentionally excluded from this repository.

The notebook and accompanying PDF are provided to illustrate the **full analysis workflow, methodology, and physical interpretation** of the experiments.
