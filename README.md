# Phys763.HW3-ReadoutAnalysis
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook developed as part of PHY 763 
(Quantum Computing Laboratory) at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.

The notebook analyzes experimental qubit readout data to extract physical
quantities such as signal-to-noise behavior and measurement fidelity.

The focus is on understanding experimental limitations rather than software
optimization.

## Learning Outcomes
- Analyzed dispersive qubit readout data from a superconducting qubit platform
- Evaluated signal-to-noise scaling and its impact on readout fidelity
- Identified physical limitations due to relaxation processes (T1)

## Files
- Phys763_HW3b.ipynb: main analysis notebook
- data: experimental datasets provided for the assignment
