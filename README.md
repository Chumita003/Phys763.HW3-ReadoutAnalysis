# Phys763.HW3-ReadoutAnalysis
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook developed as part of PHY 763 
(Quantum Computing Laboratory) at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.

The notebook analyzes experimental qubit readout data to extract physical
quantities such as signal-to-noise behavior and measurement fidelity.

The focus is on understanding experimental limitations rather than software
optimization.
